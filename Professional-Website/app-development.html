            <p>In this picture you can see one variation of a working list app. The user is able to see where to click easily with highlighted buttons and once they are done with the days task they are able to clear the list. When in development of the app I was thinking of ways to make sure it could be as user friendly as possible. It should not be complicated and anyone of all ages should be able to use it.</p>

            <p>This is the second picture of another list i was working on. In this app you are able to put your task down as well as clear each one out as you complete it which is an improvement on the last picture. I was able to make it easier to use and more practical.</p>
