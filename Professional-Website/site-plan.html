Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        In an everchanging world full of technology and innovation, it is important to keep a strong online presence so that you are able to showcase your talents and advertise your skill. For developers looking to break into the tech industry, having an online resume with some of your best projects to showcase is vital. This platform is to showcase my portfolio, allowing anyone interested to see what I can bring to the table and offer to their team and or company.

In todays competitive job market, being able to make yourself stand out is essential. A traditional paper resume doesnâ€™t always showcase a persons full capabilities, but an online professional resume on a website can give anyone a good review. I will leave some of my best projects for employers and companies looking to recruit me, and the reason my sight will be so captivating is due to it having human characteristics as well as my own personal touches. Any resume will tell you what you can do and how long you have done said job/skill, however, what if I can make it more fun to the mind, instead of boring black and white text, what if I added more colors to attract your attention, what if I showed you and let you use what I have actually done already. This is how I plan to get and keep an employers attention rather than just your boring everyday resume.
